### Prerequisites
 - Please run:
    
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate augdiff

### Datasets
STL dataset:
 - The stl dataset was downloaded using the help of: https://github.com/mttk/STL10/blob/master/stl10_input.py. 
 
 -  Images generated using code in the repository https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion. 

To use our code, please make sure that all of the images are in a file with the corresponding name. For example, if the stl images in the train set that are saved in <stl_training_path>, images of dogs should be at '<stl_train_path>/dog. Same goes for generated images, images of airpanes should be at '<gen_path>/airplane'. The labels are:

'airplane', 'bird', 'car', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'horse', 'monkey', 'ship', 'truck'

### Training:
#### For use with IDE:
After the stl dataset is downloaded, and the augmented images have been created run the following:


#### For use on google colab, please use the ipynb notebook:



Credits:
 - The NN being trained is taken from our TA's github for the Technions 046211 course - https://github.com/taldatech/ee046211-deep-learning. Specifically, from tutorial number 6.
